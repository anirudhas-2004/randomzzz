## Status

App looks mostly good. Some minor issues to figure out (aliasing etc.) but nothing critical for now.

Currently reading up on random processes — autocorrelation, PSD, and related.

Half day tomorrow is gone (temple in the morning) but will resume reading after.

Once the theory is clear, will validate everything in the app. Right now genuinely don't understand half the things being measured.

## Plan

a. Share app with sir tomorrow — tell him all issues resolved within the week (confident on this)

b. Solve the remaining issues, write some inference about the data

c. Try the machine learning part — this one is actually hard
