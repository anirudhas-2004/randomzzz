## Status

App is mostly perfect bro. Some minor issues we need to fix (aliasing etc.) but I don't think sir will notice.

Right now I am reading random processes and FFT things from some textbook.

Half day tomorrow is gone (I have to go to some temple in the morning) but I will come back home and work on this.

Then I will quickly validate everything in app. Right now genuinely don't understand half the things being da :(

## Plan

a. Share app with sir tomorrow — tell him some issues resolved within the week (confident on this)

b. Solve the remaining issues, write some inference about the data

c. Try the machine learning part — this one is actually hard
